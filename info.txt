I updated the color scheme in `app/globals.css` with these specific changes:

**Primary Colors:**

- Changed primary from cyan to vibrant purple (`--primary: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%` - violet-500)
- Updated secondary from amber to blue (`--secondary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%` - blue-500)
- Changed accent from orange to emerald (`--accent: 160 84.1% 39.4%` - emerald-500)


**Supporting Colors:**

- Updated muted backgrounds to complement the new purple theme
- Adjusted border colors for better harmony with the purple palette
- Modified destructive colors to use a more modern red shade


The layout, typography, components, and functionality remain exactly the same - only the color palette was modernized to create a more contemporary and visually appealing design.
